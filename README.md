# dinnerDaddy

## Intro

DinnerDaddy expedites the selection process during meal-time decision making. By allowing users to log in/register through Facebook, choosing where to eat becomes just as easy as eating. Groups of users who are mutual friends on Facebook, join sessions, vote for restaurants of their individual interest, and DinnerDaddy takes care of the rest!

> What's for dinner? Ask Daddy.
